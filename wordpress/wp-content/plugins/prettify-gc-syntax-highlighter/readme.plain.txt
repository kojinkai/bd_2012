== Usage ==

<pre class="prettyprint">
  // Put your code here.
</pre>

Or with shortcode:

[code]
  // Put your code here.
[/code]


== Making Code HTML Safe ==

The plugin automatically makes highlighted code html-safe:

<pre class="prettyprint">
  Anything that goes here will be quoted to appear on the page as-is.
  For example: <head></head><body></body>
</pre>

To avoid quoting your code, add <strong>dontquote</strong> as the first class:

<pre class="dontquote prettyprint">
  Remember to quote manually.
  For example: &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
</pre>


== Line Numbering ==

Line numbdering can be enabled as follows:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  // Put your code here.
</pre>

If you want to start with a line number 42, you can do the following:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums:42">
  // Put your code here.
</pre>


== Highlighting Lines ==

When line numbering is enabled you can highlight one or several lines of code using the highlight class:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-YOURLANG linenums highlight:2,4">
  // line 2
  // line 3
  // line 4
</pre>

Alternatively you can highlight one or several code segments:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-YOURLANG linenums highlight:1-3,5-6">
  // line 2
  // line 3
  // line 4
  // line 5
</pre>

Note: This feature is not available when line numbering is disabled.


== Specifying Language ==

Most of the time the highlighter will do a good job guessing how to highlight the code. However, to achieve the best result, you should specify the language:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-YOURLANG">
  // Put your code here.
</pre>

Replace YOURLANG with one of the following:

  * aea
  * agc
  * apollo
  * bsh
  * c
  * cc
  * cl
  * cpp
  * cs
  * csh
  * css-str
  * cv
  * cxx
  * cyc
  * default-markup
  * el
  * fs
  * go
  * hs
  * htm
  * html
  * java
  * js
  * json
  * lisp
  * lua
  * m
  * ml
  * mxml
  * perl
  * pl
  * pm
  * proto
  * py
  * rb
  * scala
  * scm
  * sh
  * sql
  * vhd
  * vhdl
  * wiki
  * xhtml
  * xml
  * xsl
  * yaml
  * yml


== Shortcode ==

Here is a quick example. All the parameters are optional.

[code lang="scala" start="1" highlight="1-3,6,10-14" background="#C0FFB3"]
  // Put your code here.
[/code]

Html quoting can be disabled as follows:

[code quote="false"]
  // Put your code here.
[/code]

The contents of shortcodes is auto-formatted by WP. As a result <p> and </br> tags along
with some formatting will be lost. If you need to preseve the original formatting use
html notation instead of the shortcode.
