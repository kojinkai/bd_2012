CSS

A note about CSS. The twentyeleven theme comes fitted with excellent responsive styles. 
However I wanted to incorporate the CSS reset found in Paul Irish et al's HTML5 Boilerplate.
Therefore any updates to the parent theme will require the twentyeleven style.css to be copied
across to the css folder of the bd_2012 child theme.
